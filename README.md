# Activity 1
A research done by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with children and teens who go to school regularly and are users of mobile devices (tablets, smartphones, and laptops) shows that in Western countries, specially in the Northern hemisphere, the daily use by the following age ranges are:

- from 2 to 7 years old, average use of 3 hours per day
- from 8 to 12 years old, average use of 4 hours and 45 minutes per day
- from 13 to 18 years old, average use of 6 hours per day

Make a program where the user enters his age and the amount of hours of his daily use. Then verify if this person fits, is below or is above the average defined by the research. Show the result to the user by means of a message.
